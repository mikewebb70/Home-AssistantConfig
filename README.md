# My Current Home Assistant configuration

I'm useing travis-ci to valid my configuration [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikewebb70/Home-AssistantConfig.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikewebb70/Home-AssistantConfig)

Learn more about[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) and how to use it. I have installed an official image made for raspberry pi and is an all in one solution with built in expansion called HASS.IO perfect for development or proof of concept.  Very easy to install.

I am in the middle of moving over to lovelaceUI using a differnet branch on a local gitlab server.  So this repository does not reflect my current setup.  Once I'm happy with where I'm at with lovelace and my configuration, I will start a dev branch and merge to master and deal with that and travis.
